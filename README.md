Executive Overview 
(GRAPH OVERVIEWS INCLUDED AFTER EXECUTIVE PAGE ON PAGES 2 thru 4)

•	1/3rd of all Kickstarter campaigns were related to Theatre.  The successful Theater campaigns set goal amounts under $10,000, and their best success rate was seen when they launched in Spring (months May and June), with least success when launched in December

•	Other than Faith, Jazz, and World Music within the Music category, which these genres saw 0% campaign success, all other Music categories achieved 100% success (Indie-Rock, the exception at 87%).  These successful campaigns had set goals under $3,300

•	1 out of 4 of the Kickstarter campaigns fell into sub-categories where 100% of those campaigns failed or were canceled.   Food trucks, Web projects, and Animated film projects were the largest failed sub-categories
